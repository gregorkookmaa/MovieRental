Gregor Kookmaa (KTA20-E) School project that uses ASP.NET Core. The objective of this project was to create a CMS (Client Management System) for a hypothetical Movie Rental shop/app/system. It gives an overview of the clients, movies in the system and client renting dates and expiry dates. And a way to Add, Edit and delete these details. All of the information is stored in an SQL database.
